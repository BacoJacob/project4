**Things I liked about Prolog**
- It is cool way to use programming and logic
- Basic logic is simple
- Free range to code however you like

**Problems I Had**
- I was able to find a way to tell what month comes before nother, but I could not figure out a way to implement it in puzzle2
- The open nature of coding left many ways to do the same problem, but this made looking for information hard
